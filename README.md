The task of this project is to perform classification using machine learning
The task of this project is to perform classification using machine learning. It is for a two class problem.
The features used for classification are pre-computed from images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of
a breast mass. Your task is to classify suspected FNA cells to Benign (class 0) or Malignant 
(class 1) using logistic regression as the classifier. The dataset in use is the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast
Cancer (wdbc.dataset).
